Measurement
===========

The measurements used in iiag are standardized. Our measurement system is
adjusted from the ancient Egyptian system of measurement.

Length
------

Each space in the game world is 2 royal cubits (𓇓𓏏𓈖 𓂣 ) long.

Weight
------

The standard unit of weight is a new kingdom deben (𓄲 𓈖 𓊌). The new kingdom one
is used because it is larger than the old/middle kingdom one. This is the displayed
value, but the unit specified internally (in config files and the like) is specified
in hundredths of deben.

Time
----

In game time is divided normally, with the addition of eras. Seasons and months
have yet to be implemented, which will probably follow arbitrarily decided months
and seasons or the ancient Egyptian model. In-game steps (used to specified speeds
in config files) are specified in hundredths of seconds.
